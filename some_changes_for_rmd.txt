Another way of writing the workflow when there is only one input. Here `num` is the only input channel.

```{bash, attr.source='.numberLines',eval=FALSE, class.source="nohide"}

workflow {           #5
    num | basicExample
}

```

5. When the process declares exactly one input, the pipe | operator can be used to provide inputs to the process, instead of passing it as a parameter.
